# <Dinner-and-a-Movie>

## Description
Have ever been at home on a friday night or have a date night and don't know what to eat and watch? Well, Dinner and a Movie is here to help. Our application will help you by generating a random meal and movie so you more time doing the things you love rather than just deciding. 

- The motivation for this project was to learn how to develop in a collaborative environment and also to implement the skills we have been learning in fetching data from external API's.
- This project resolves the problem of not being able to decide what to cook and what to watch.
- We learned how to collaborate on Github while working separately on certain aspects of the page. We also learned how to work with multiple API's to build one cohesive application.
