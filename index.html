        <!-- Lately, we have been spending much more time at home. And with that, we
        have been watching more movies and making more food ourselves. Have you
        ever been stuck on what to watch or what to eat? Whether you're alone or
        with someone, you can't decide what to land on so you go with the same
        food and the same movie you've seen over and over. Well, we have a
        solution for you! Dinner and a Movie, where we pick what you eat and
        watch. No more date night fights, or the same boring meal. The user will
        start on our landing page which will make them hungry and excited based
        on our color scheme, and once they enter the site they will be brought
        here, with the name up top and a brief description and instructions. On
        the left they will have a drop down option for food type with a generate
        button, a dropdown option with movie genres and generate button, or they
        can generate both together randomly. On the right we will have a picture
        of the generated food, the title, list of ingredients and recipe
        instructions with a link to a video. And on the right of that we will
        have a movie poster with the ratings, description, where to watch link
        and year released. If you like one, but not the other, you can click the
        movie OR food generate button for a new exciting response. -->
        Welcome to Dinner and a Movie where you randomly choose what to eat and
        watch so can spend more time doing the things you love
        <br />
        Click on the food and movie buttons below and a random dish and movie
        will generate
